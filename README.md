# PRASOC Loan Simulation for BIAT

This project simulates how PRASOC loans given to different types of SMEs affect repayment performance at BIAT. It compares stable vs. high-potential companies using Monte Carlo simulations, displaying repayment trends and risks.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

Clone this repository, navigate to the project directory, and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone <your_repo_url>
cd project
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Right now there are three stable options:
1-
./main.py
This is useful to show the growth of a single PME, compare all PMEs, and see how they impact BIAT
2-
/scoring/main_scoring.py
Useful to calculate the ESG scores
3-
/loan_strategies/main.py
Useful to show the advantage of a prosac loan over the classical loan

--> loan_comparison, prasoc_impact are not useful right now
--> no need to look at core
